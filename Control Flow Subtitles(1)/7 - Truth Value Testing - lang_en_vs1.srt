00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,270
So far, the conditions we've used were

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,140
Boolean expressions that evaluate to a Boolean object,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,955
either true or false.

4
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:17,679
If we put some other object that is not a Boolean in the IF statement,

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,550
Python will check for its truth value and

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,515
use that to decide whether or not to run the indented code.

7
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:29,875
Here, the condition is an integer variable and evaluates to true.

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,350
The Python documentation lists

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,450
all the objects that are considered false in this situation.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,320
Anything that isn't listed as having a truth value false will evaluate as true.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,425
In this code, errors has a truth value true because it's a non-zero number.

12
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:51,170
So the error message is printed.

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,060
This is a nice way of writing a succinct IF statement.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,760
Similarly, in this example you saw earlier,

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,985
the string in the second part of this condition will evaluate to true.

16
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:07,250
So this statement will always evaluate to true

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,293
regardless of what value is stored in weather.

18
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:16,920
Alternatively, this will evaluate to true If weather is the string snow,

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,099
and will evaluate to false if weather is any other string.

20
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,600
However, these types of conditions aren't

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,000
really common knowledge and are not common in practice.
