00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,175
Welcome to this lesson on Control Flow.

2
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:08,310
Here, you'll learn how to add more functionality to

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,555
your code by being able to use conditional statements and loops.

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:16,170
You'll learn how to implement decision-making with if statements,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,170
repeat code with for and while loops,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,410
exit or skip loops with break and continue,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,070
use helpful built-in functions like zip and enumerate,

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,240
and combine some of these concepts in concise list comprehensions.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,190
With these tools, you'll be able to bring together the data types and operators you

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,380
learned from the previous lesson in more complex and creative ways. Let's get started.
