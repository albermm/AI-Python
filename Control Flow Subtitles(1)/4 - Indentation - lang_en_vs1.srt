1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,835
As you have just seen, indentation is important.

2
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:11,385
It's how we tell Python what code is in the body of an if statement,

3
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:13,695
and what code is outside of it.

4
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:17,145
Indentation doesn't just matter in if statements.

5
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:20,280
Soon, you'll see it used in other contexts.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,100
Some other languages use braces to show where blocks of code begin and end.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,975
In Python, we use indentation to enclose blocks of code.

8
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:36,330
This indentation conventionally comes in multiples of four spaces.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,330
It's important to be strict about following this convention because

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,780
changing the indentation can completely change the meaning of the code.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,315
If you are working on a team of Python programmers,

12
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:52,060
it's important that everyone follows the same indentation convention.
