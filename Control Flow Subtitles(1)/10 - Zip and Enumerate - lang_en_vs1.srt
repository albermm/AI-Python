00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,315
Looking back at our list of cargo,

2
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:06,825
notice each element is a tuple of size two.

3
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:09,855
Iterating through a list with multiple values,

4
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:11,445
can be pretty helpful.

5
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:16,140
It's actually really easy to combine and split lists like this.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,225
If we originally started,

7
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:21,645
with these two separate lists, items and weights,

8
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:24,210
and wanted to combine them to create a list,

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,710
like manifest, we can use a built-in function called zip.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,275
Zip, returns an iterator.

11
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:35,056
So, we need to convert it to a list to see the elements.

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,545
Or, iterate through it with a for loop,

13
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:40,815
if we want to print the values, similar to range.

14
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:45,300
You could also unpack each tuple in a for loop like this.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,165
In addition to zipping two lists together,

16
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:51,480
you can also unzip a list using an asterisk.

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,245
For example, using the manifest lists like this,

18
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:59,565
you can separate it into an items and weights list, like this.

19
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:03,015
The next function we'll look at, is enumerate.

20
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:07,260
Many times, you'll find it useful to iterate through the values of a list,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,000
along with the index.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,355
This is one way you could do it.

23
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:16,560
This uses a for loop to iterate through a list of tuples containing the index,

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,380
and value of each item in the list.

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,740
The indices are created by getting a range object from zero,

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,220
to the length of items minus one,

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,145
and zipping that with the values in items.

28
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:34,437
Enumerate, is a special built-in function that makes this a lot simpler.

29
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:36,330
Enumerate returns these tuples,

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,105
containing the indices and values of a list,

31
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:41,100
in an iterable for you.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,500
You'll be getting some practice using Zip and Enumerate and see how helpful they can be,

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,120
in the following quiz section.
