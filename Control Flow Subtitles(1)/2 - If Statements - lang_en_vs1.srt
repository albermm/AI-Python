00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,745
We've been running code that simply executes every line one by one from the top down.

2
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:14,340
Many times however, we want to run code only if a particular condition holds.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,365
To demonstrate this concept,

4
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:20,895
let's take a look at this billing system for a pay-as-you-go mobile phone.

5
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,430
Say a customer has a credit balance for

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,225
their phone which they can use for calls and messages.

7
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:31,080
The customer can then set up a link to their bank account so that

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,770
if their phone credit balance goes below a threshold amount,

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,765
in this case five dollars,

10
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:41,690
then 10 more dollars of credit are added and their bank balance is build.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,430
Here is a simple way of representing this billing system in code.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,010
If the phone balance is below five,

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,630
add 10 to phone balance and subtract 10 from bank balance.

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,795
This is an example of an if statement.

15
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:00,770
An if statement is a conditional statement that runs or

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,465
skips code based on whether a condition is true or false.

17
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:10,475
In an if statement, the if keyword is followed by the condition to be checked,

18
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:13,132
in this case, phone balanced less than five,

19
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,380
and then a colon.

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,990
The condition is specified in

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,665
a Boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false.

22
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:27,815
After this line is an indented block of code to be executed if the condition is true.

23
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:29,435
So in this case,

24
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:35,030
these lines will only execute if it is true that phone balance is less than five.

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,910
If phone balance is five,

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,860
this condition evaluates to true and these indented lines of code are executed.

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,550
You can observe these changes in the output.

28
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,440
If phone balance is eight however,

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,370
this condition evaluates to false and these lines are not executed.

30
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,290
As you see in the output,

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,110
there were no changes to phone or bank balance,

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,200
which is what we expect to happen since the condition in this if statement was false.
