1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,910
All the if and elif statements we've seen so far have been

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,715
followed by a single Boolean expression that checks only one condition.

3
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:17,580
However, more complicated Boolean expressions can be useful as well.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,585
If the condition is working with the numerical variable,

5
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:23,360
you might want to check whether a value lies in

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,705
a certain range or even do some calculation in order to make a comparison.

7
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:32,430
Notice this condition uses logic and algebra,

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,295
and will still run correctly in Python.

9
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:38,145
Storing values for height and weight,

10
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:41,395
we can quickly print the result for any individual.

11
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:45,385
Some situations may call for logical operators.

12
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:47,385
If it's rainy and sunny,

13
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:49,415
I might look for a rainbow.

14
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:53,200
Notice that the if statement here requires that both of

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,815
these individual variables hold true to evaluate as true.

16
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,440
If either is false,

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,230
then this line will evaluate as false,

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,855
and our print statement will not run.

19
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,980
Let's say I want to send a promotional email to a customer,

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,160
if they have not requested to be taken off the email list,

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,010
and they're in a location where they'll be able to redeem the offer.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,370
For really complicated conditions,

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,635
you might need to combine some ands,

24
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,870
ors, and nots together.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,250
Use parentheses if you need to make the combinations clear.

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,230
However, simple or complex,

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,020
the entire line in an if statement must be

28
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,565
a Boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false,

29
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,460
and it is this value that decides whether the

30
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,000
indented block in an if statement executes or not.
