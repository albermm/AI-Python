1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:08,405
Now you know how to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

2
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:11,460
But what if you have a different block of code that you

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,810
want to execute when that condition is false?

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,675
You can use the 'else' keyword to do so.

5
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:20,910
Consider this code, which prints a message indicating

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,050
whether an integer N is even or odd.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,284
If N is even,

8
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:27,760
this line is run.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,525
Otherwise, this line is run.

10
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:37,425
Code indented under the 'else' is what happens when this condition evaluates to false.

11
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:42,660
The 'else' keyword is always followed by a colon and doesn't need a Boolean expression.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,545
So, if we set N to be 4 like this,

13
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:52,820
the if statement here would evaluate to true and we would print the following string.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,364
Alternatively, if we set N to be 15,

15
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:59,790
this condition would evaluate to false so we would skip

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,705
this block and execute the code under the else.

17
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:06,385
If you have more than two possible cases,

18
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:08,350
you can also use elif,

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,270
short for 'else if',

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,425
to deal with the situation.

21
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:16,000
This saves the multiple indentation that would be needed if

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,235
we used 'else' and then another 'if' statement inside the 'else' block.

23
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:25,873
Like 'if', an elif statement always requires a conditional expression.

24
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:28,610
For example, let's say we wanted to print what

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,085
to do with the garden based on the current season.

26
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:35,480
If we set season equal to spring, like this,

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,850
then we can see that plant the garden is

28
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,060
printed as its first condition evaluates to true.

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,470
Alternatively, if we set season to winter,

30
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,685
then each of these conditions will evaluate to false until we had

31
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:54,945
this condition which will evaluate as true and print stay indoors.

32
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:58,300
Notice here we're using double equal sign again.

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,030
Remember, a single equal sign is for assignment like we did

34
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,150
here when we were setting a season as a particular string.

35
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,000
Two equal sign is for evaluation where we are evaluating a condition as true or false.
